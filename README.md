## üéØ Objective

Focus Guardian aims to solve the challenge of maintaining focus and understanding productivity habits in digital work environments. It serves students, professionals, remote workers, or anyone looking to minimize distractions and enhance their concentration.

The application provides value by:
1.  **Objectively Tracking Focus:** Using AI analysis of webcam and screen activity to determine if the user is engaged in work-related tasks.
2.  **Providing Actionable Insights:** Aggregating data on focus time, distraction time, and application usage, presented through historical logs and visual charts.
3.  **Facilitating Reflection:** Offering an AI chat assistant that leverages the user's productivity data to provide contextual feedback, encouragement, and answers to queries about their performance patterns.

## üß™ How to Run the Project

### Requirements:
- Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB instance (local or cloud like MongoDB Atlas)
- Groq API Key

### Environment Setup:

1.  **Backend (`backend` directory):**
    *   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory.
    *   Add the following variables:
        ```env
        MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
        JWT_SECRET=your_strong_jwt_secret_key
        GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
        PORT=8080 # Or any port you prefer
        # Optional:
        # NODE_ENV=development
        # FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000 # For CORS in production
        # JSON_LIMIT=1mb # Or adjust as needed
        ```

2.  **Frontend (`frontend` directory):**
    *   Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory (usually the root of the React app).
    *   Add the following variable, pointing to your backend server:
        ```env
        REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080 # Or your backend's URL
        ```

### Local Setup:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/[Your-GitHub-Username]/[Your-Repo-Name]
cd [Your-Repo-Name]

# Setup Backend
cd backend
npm install
npm start # Or npm run dev if you have a dev script

# Setup Frontend (in a separate terminal)
cd ../frontend # Assuming frontend is sibling to backend
npm install
npm start


The frontend should now be accessible (usually at http://localhost:3000) and communicating with the backend (running at http://localhost:8080 or your specified port).

üß¨ Future Scope

List improvements, extensions, or follow-up features:

üìà Advanced Analytics: Implement weekly/monthly reports, identify long-term trends, and provide more granular insights into distraction triggers.

üéØ Goal Setting: Allow users to set focus goals (e.g., duration, percentage) and track progress.

‚ú® Personalized Recommendations: Suggest break times or focus techniques based on detected patterns of distraction.

üìÖ Integrations: Connect with calendar apps to automatically associate sessions with events or task management tools (e.g., Todoist, Jira).

üîî Customizable Alerts: Allow users to configure alerts for prolonged distraction periods.

üì± Mobile Companion App: A simpler app for viewing stats and maybe starting/stopping sessions remotely.

üõ°Ô∏è Security Enhancements: Implement refresh tokens, more robust input validation, and potential end-to-end encryption for chat (if needed).

üåê Localization: Add support for multiple languages in the UI and potentially the chatbot interaction.
